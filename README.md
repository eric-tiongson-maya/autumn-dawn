## Autumn Dawn

### Introduction

This project is intended to test the capabilities of various SCA tools including Snyk, Dependabot and Gitlab's gemnasium.

### Project Template

This project is based on a GitLab [Java Spring template project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-project.html).

Improvements can be proposed in the [original project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/project-templates/spring).

### Optional CI/CD with Auto DevOps

*Important Note:* Do not turn on Auto DevOps while the SCA testing is ongoing. 

This template is compatible with [Auto DevOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/).

If Auto DevOps is not already enabled for this project, you can [turn it on](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/#enabling-auto-devops) in the project settings.
